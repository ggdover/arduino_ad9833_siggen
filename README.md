# Summary

This is a project for a simple hook-up of the AD9833 chip, which
is a programmable waveform generator, so basically can be used as a
shitty/scuffed function/signal generator.

Only other thing used with the AD9833 is a arduino nano used to
power supply and control it, setting different frequencies etc.

# Instructable guide and pictures of circuit/setup

The code (located in folder FILMFH7JNAL4JNU) is a complete copy-paste 
from this guide on instractables.com
https://www.instructables.com/Signal-Generator-AD9833/

also the circuit setup is also taken from that guide.
You'll find all the info you need on how to set different frequencies
etc. when the arduino code is running in the instructables link aswell.

Incase the link becomes invalid, there is a backup of this site, saved in the
folder 'instructable site backup' in this repository.

You can also find some pictures in the folder 'pictures' in this repository,
to see what the circuit looks like hooked up, and what the output from the ad9833
looks like on a oscilloscope.
